A 2-day "Design Camp" I hosted for the Design, Cultures, & Creativity Honors College. This workshop was a combination of digital media theory, art history, and hands-on creation where students learned now to create glitch art with Notepad++, livecode with Hydra, and navigate GitHub. By the end of the workshop, students had made their first pull requests to our workshop's collective "portfolio."
