A Halloween-themed joint workshop and algorave funded by University of Maryland's ArtsAMP Collaborative Student Microgrants. During the workshop, we taught attendees how to creatively livecode using the web tools Hydra and Strudel. During the algorave, nine artists from all across the East Coast performed algorithmic music sets with live coded visuals, while two art installations by UMD alumni ran in the upstairs gallery.
