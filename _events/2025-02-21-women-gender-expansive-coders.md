Have you ever wondered what kind of creative work you can make with technology? Come join us to learn more about using code as a medium. During the workshop, we will explore livecoding as a form of performance that allows us to improvise with visuals and sound, using the open-source frameworks Hydra and Strudel. Some programming experience is helpful here, but beginners are also welcome. Please bring your own laptop!
