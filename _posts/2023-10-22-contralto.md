# Contralto

Built Winter-Spring 2022 with Python, Flask, SQL, Chart.js, and the Spotify API. Deployed with Heroku and Supabase. I wrote an algorithm to determine an artist's gender identity (or a group's gender representation) using Chartmetric's [gender and pronouns database](https://makemusicequal.chartmetric.com/pronoun-gender-database){:target="_blank"} or, if not represnted there, the pronouns used in the artist's [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/home){:target="_blank"} bio.  

Prior to building the app, I designed high-fidelity prototypes in Adobe XD to establish the color scheme and typography.  

Inspired by my love for the male-dominated genres of rock and metal.
