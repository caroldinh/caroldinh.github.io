# Early Birds (2023)

Built Fall 2023 with D3.js and Twitter API data. I became curious about who else had first-name Twitter handles after stalking some rock star profiles (@Billy and formerly @Courtney). This is my first data-driven visual story.   

in February 2023, after first coming up with the project idea, I wrote a script collecting profile details from the Twitter API for accounts of 180 popular American first names. Then I put off parsing the data until the fall. At that point, Elon Musk had renamed Twitter to X and put the API behind a paywall. I decided to finish the project while the platform was still around.
