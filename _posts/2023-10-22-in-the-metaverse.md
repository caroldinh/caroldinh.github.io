# In The Metaverse (2022)

Popularized in the English language by Agha Shahid Ali, the ghazal is one of my favorite poetry forms. For my ARTT255 Digital Art class, I made a video in Adobe Premiere Pro to accompany a ghazal I'd written about the metaverse buzz. The voiceover is my own reading with sound effects from FreeSound.org. Inspired by the hypersaturated "corporate art style," I illustrated each panel in Adobe Photoshop and edited handwritten scans of the poem in time with the recording.

### In the Metaverse

*World closed down for today? Try your luck in the metaverse.*   
*Tear yourself from this big plague, life won’t suck in the metaverse.*  

*It’s not just legless avatars, we have wizards and dragons.*   
*You could be an oversized rubber duck in the metaverse.*  

*Join us after the big game, rock out and you’ll see: young punks*   
*drum against industry, grow up, chum with Zuck in the metaverse.*  

*Promoted post: celeb artist sells out, shakes hands with crypto corp*  
*and mints magnum opus into NFT for a buck in the metaverse.*   

*Time for morning news. Megacorp scandals: here’s another one*   
*about—oh, let me guess—about what, the fuckin’ metaverse?!*  

*I’ll show them, I thought, that there’s more to this major than corporate tech—*  
*ha! Joke’s on you, cyborgforty, you’re now stuck in the metaverse.*
