# FOR THE RECORD (2021)

HDCC105 final project. "For The Record" is an AR collage exploring the relationship between your camera app and present experience. How does documentation impact your ability to "enjoy the moment?" How is your brain shaped by the tools you hold? Hold the AR app up to the poster to access the experience.   

Built in Unity using AR Foundation's Image Tracking. Poster designed in Photoshop.
