# GENERATIVE AI ART PROMPTS FOR HUMANS (2023)

An interactive journal/minizine reflecting on creativity and generative AI. Choose your own stickers to assemble your own fill-in-the-blank prompt.   

I created this zine to share the idea of [critical making](https://www.conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/){:target="_blank"} or learning by doing, a hands-on approach to exploring questions within art, technology, and society. I had seen Twitter debates that ended in something along the lines of, "Did you say AI? As in art theft? Blocked." I understand the frustration of watching human creativity become corrupted by capitalism and the cult of productivity. But a lot of the artists and scholars who inspire me - including [Lillian-Yvonne Bertram](https://www.lillianyvonnebertram.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Lauren Lee McCarthy](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Nettrice Gaskins](https://www.nettricegaskins.com/){:target="_blank"} - have been using algorithms and AI in their art and scholarship long before it became a buzzword. I admire their work and wanted to create a zine to facilitate more open-minded and critical conversations about AI.   

Designed using Adobe Photoshop and InDesign and distributed at D.C. Zinefest and on the University of Maryland campus.
