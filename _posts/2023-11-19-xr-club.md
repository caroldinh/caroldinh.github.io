# XR Club Website (2022)

Redesign of the University of Maryland's [XR Club](https://xr.umd.edu/){:target="_blank"} website. In Spring 2022, I created a prototype of the re-design using Adobe XD and implemented it in React.js over the summer. View comparison screenshots against the old design below.
