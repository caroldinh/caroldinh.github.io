# NEW BLOOD JOINS THIS EARTH (2024)

A data visualization about the international, inter-generational, cross-genre influence of Metallica, analyzing the 55 songs on Metallica's cover compailation *The Metallica Blacklist* (2021) celebrating thirty years of their eponymous "Black Album." Created using **React.js, AnyChart.js,** and **Flourish** for visualization; **Python, Jupyter Notebook,** and **Excel** for data processing. Data retrieved from the Spotify API, scraped from an archived EveryNoiseAtOnce, and hand-gathered.
