# GAIAXUS (2024-PRESENT)

In my current position, I develop user-facing software for water quality monitoring devices at GaiaXus, a Germantown, Md.-based startup. As my first full-time position out of college, it has been a rewarding and challenging experience and I have learned a lot about environmental science, user interface design, and the field of educational technology.  

Primarily, I develop the mobile app, which is available on Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks. I have also had the opportunity to edit videos, create motion graphics, and re-design the company's website. Below are samples of my work.

**Tools:** React Native, TypeScript, AWS, Adobe Creative Suite, WordPress
