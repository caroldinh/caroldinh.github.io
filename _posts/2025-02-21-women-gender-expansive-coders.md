# LIVECODING WORKSHOP FOR WOMEN AND GENDER EXPANSIVE CODERS DC
Have you ever wondered what kind of creative work you can make with technology? Come join us to learn more about using code as a medium. During the workshop, we will explore livecoding as a form of performance that allows us to improvise with visuals and sound, using the open-source frameworks Hydra and Strudel. Some programming experience is helpful here, but beginners are also welcome. Please bring your own laptop!
