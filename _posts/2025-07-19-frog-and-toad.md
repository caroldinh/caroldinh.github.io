# SET PAINTING FOR *A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD* (2025)

I painted roughly 125 square feet of set elements for Rockville Musical Theatre's summer production, *A Year with Frog and Toad* (dir. Chad Rabago), acrylic on cardboard. This was my first time set painting for a theatrical production!   

"Set pieces (especially the clothes rack), and beautiful set painting by Caroline Dinh created scenes from the middle of a pond to sledding down a snowy hill. The set design elements give the audience so much to look at, one could see it twice and still catch things that were missed the first time." *[Danielle Comer via MD Theatre Guide](https://mdtheatreguide.com/2025/07/theatre-review-a-year-with-frog-and-toad-presented-by-rockville-musical-theatre-in-partnership-with-gaithersburg-arts-barn/){:target="_blank"}*  

"The seasonal transitions were also cleverly handled. Scenic elements painted by Caroline Dinh featured cardboard boxes with different seasons on each side, rotated by the cast to mark time passing." *[Lucille Blumberg via TheatreBloom](https://www.theatrebloom.com/2025/07/a-year-with-frog-and-toad-at-rockville-musical-theatre/){:target="_blank"}*
