# GaiaXus Web Portal

There was a time at the beginning of my position where GaiaXus's Web Portal was so minimal, that we wondered if we needed it at all. Now, some of our system's most powerful functionalities are initialized on the Portal, from setting up projects to developing educational content. My work on the portal has included:

## Launching a project management system for classrooms, volunteer, and research groups

## Integrating mapping, LLMs, and citizen science data into content builder for engaging, hyperlocal experiences  

## Refactoring content management system for efficiency and version control   

## Refactoring database indexes and schema for a fast, visually pleasing data review interface
