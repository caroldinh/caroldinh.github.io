# GaiaXus Mobile App

When I first joined GaiaXus, its sensors were controlled by a prototypical mobile app that worked only on Android tablets, designed under the assumption that it would be used primarily by students who would not have access to smartphones but rather budget school-provided equipment. My work on the app has included:

## Expanding compatibility to smartphones, Chromebooks, and iOS

## Refactoring data review and filtering interface

## Developing intuitive sensor calibration workflow

## Implementing project and content sharing interface

## Evaluating app for WCAG 2.2 compliance
