<h1>GAIAXUS (2024-PRESENT)</h1>

<p>In my current position, I develop user-facing software for water quality monitoring devices at GaiaXus, a Germantown,
    Md.-based startup. As my first full-time position out of college, it has been a rewarding and challenging experience
    and I have learned a lot about environmental science, user interface design, and the field of educational
    technology. </p>

<p>As a multimedia technologist and former environmental educator in a small company, I take on many roles in the
    company. My work involves:</p>

<details>

    <summary>HCI & FULL-STACK DEVELOPMENT</summary>

    <p>When I first joined the company, the mobile app and web portal were used only by the engineers on the team and a
        small number of testers. I have since advanced the original prototypical interfaces into production-ready
        software, re-designing every screen to communicate with three additional sensor models and better present data
        and educational modules for classroom and citizen science users.
    <p>

    <p>On the front-end, this work includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designing high-fidelity user interface mockups for data collection, device management, and citizen science
            projects in Figma</li>
        <li>Implementing new designs for mobile application and web portal with React Native, React, and Next.js</li>
        <li>Introducing responsiveness to original tablet layout to make compatible with mobile phones and Chromebooks
        </li>
        <li>Translating sensor calibration procedures from internal command-line interface to user-facing graphical modules</li>
        <li>Coordinating with <a href="https://nitrate.com/" target="_blank">NECI</a> scientists to integrate nitrate and
            phosphate calibration procedures into the mobile app</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On the back-end, this work includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Optimizing usage of AWS Amplify, S3, and Lambda to reduce loading time of multimedia content from minutes to
            seconds</li>
        <li>Developing relational data models for projects, labs (multimedia modules), lab results, and water quality
            data</li>
        <li>Implementing data automation, ArcGIS integration, and API functions with AWS Lambda</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And on the DevOps side, this work includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Managing the Android build and release process using Android Studio and the Google Play Store</li>
        <li>Guiding a team of contractors to port our existing Android app into an iOS app on the App Store</li>
    </ul>

    <summary>GRAPHIC & MULTIMEDIA DESIGN</summary>
    <p>
        I have also had the opportunity to edit videos, create motion graphics, and re-design the company's website
        using Adobe Creative Suite and WordPress. Below are samples of multimedia work.

    <summary>OUTREACH & EDUCATION</summary>
    <p>
        The "human" side of human-computer interaction, I have also facilitated outreach and engagement with members of the community, including having conversations with teachers and citizen science leaders, tabling at KID Museum in Bethesda, supervising a high school student's stormwater runoff simulation in the GaiaXus lab.

    <summary>TOUCHING GRASS (WELL, WATER)</summary>
    <p>This is not just a software job --- this is a job that touches electronics and takes me outside! I am grateful to be working on a product whose primary impact is not in front of a screen, but out by the river or stream. The real-world impact of my work keeps me grounded and reminds me why I am here.</p>
