## Privacy Policy for Archie

## Information We Collect

We collect and store only your Discord server’s ID and name, the name of your currently active Archive category, and the names of any “frozen” channels and categories. The bot can read your channel names and message history, but this information is not collected or stored and is neither accessible to the developer nor other users of the bot.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measure is perfect, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

## Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will post the updated policy on our website. Your continued use of `Archie` after we make changes to this policy indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.
