# ABOUT âœ¦

Caroline Dinh is thinking about science fiction, new media art, and the digital humanities. By day, she develops software for environmental education; by night, she folds zines, reads novels, and chips away at her own. Caroline holds a B.S. in Immersive Media Design from the University of Maryland and resides on occupied Piscataway land.   

Reach out if you want to talk zine trades, commissions, or creative workshops; I'd love to hear from you. My email is cdinhart [at] gmail [dot] com.
